# Billing Overview

At the beginning of each month, the Billing Owner for the workspace will be billed for the previous month’s activity. 
Your Expensify bill is determined by: 
- The number of active members in your workspace
- Whether you have a Collect or Control plan
- Whether you’re on pay-per-use or an annual subscription
- Whether you’re using the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card
- Active members

An active member is anyone who chats, creates, submits, approves, reimburses, or exports a report in Expensify in any given month. This includes Copilots and automatic actions by Concierge.

## Collect vs Control plan

Control plan coming soon, comparison to follow.

## Pay-per-use vs annual subscription

**Pay-per-use**

With the pay-per-use rate, you pay the full rate per active member. 
- **Collect plan:** $20 per active member
- **Control plan:** $36 per active member

**Annual**

With the annual rate, you set your monthly active member count at the beginning of your subscription and get 50% off your monthly active member cost. 
- **Collect plan:** $10 per active member
- **Control plan:** $18 per active member

If you have any additional active members above the number included in your set member count, they will be billed at the pay-per-use rate. You can also choose to increase your annual subscription size, which will extend your annual subscription length. However, you cannot reduce your annual subscription size until your current subscription has ended. For questions, contact Concierge or your account manager.

## The Expensify Card

Bundling the Expensify Card with an annual subscription provides you with the lowest monthly price for Expensify. And the more you spend with the Expensify Cards, the lower your bill will be.

If at least 50% of your approved USD spend in a given month is on your company’s Expensify Cards, you will receive an additional 50% discount on the price per active member when paired with the annual subscription. 
- **Collect plan:** $5 per active member
- **Control plan:** $9 per active member

Additionally, you receive cash back every month that is first applied to your Expensify bill, further reducing your price per member. Any leftover cash back is deposited directly into your connected bank account. 
- 1% cash back on all Expensify Card purchases
- 2% cash back if the amount spent across your Expensify Cards is $250k or more (for U.S. purchases only)
